    <p> My favorite extracurricular activity is the leo club.
        The club aims to provide youths with an opportunity to contribute individually
        and collectively to the local, national and international community as responsible 
        citizens. We volunteer for clean up activities and lend a helping hand to those
        who are not as privileged by for example offering tutoring classes.

        Community service is something that I have cherished since I was in high school
        because I like to help people in any little way that I can and being able to put a smile on people's 
        faces makes me very happy.
